Desktop based sales application projects using the CRUD method

The use of CRUD in sales applications is a method that can be connected to the interface as a facilitator to make changes to data or display information in the form of forms, tables or reports. This form will later be displayed in a browser or application on the user's computer device.

CRUD functions are Create, Read, Update and Delete. This method is not limited to web development, but can also be applied to software.

1. Create
Create is the process of adding or creating new data to the application. For example, when you register on a website page, the data you enter will be automatically added to the database as new data.

2. Read
Read is the process of retrieving data from the database. An example of this process runs when you click Login, and enter data in the e-mail and password fields. Then the website will carry out a reading process (read) to verify the data that you have entered.

3. Update
Update is the process of changing existing data in the database. When the user makes changes to the data that has been input, and saves it, the series of processes is called an update. For example, when you change your username or password.

4. Delete
Delete process in CRUD is to delete data in the database. This process is similar to updating because it will change existing data. But the difference is, the delete method will delete the data that has been selected.

The problem lies in the system which is still manual, therefore making a sales information system is a way to improve the quality of information services and speed up the sales transaction process. The system will later calculate transactions, input data on goods, and report the results of sales of goods. Based on these problems, the development of an information system for selling electronic devices is carried out to help manage goods data, record transactions, make reports on goods data and sales to be more structured and reduce the risk of loss.
